The Dead Simple Human Powered Airplane (DaSH PA or "DaSH") project is using FlightGear to help train the "DaSH pilots" with a DaSH model constructed by Marshall Gusman. Download "dash_v1" model from:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-4Q5D ... sp=sharing

I have three requests:
(a) get feedback on the model (does it work for you? What needs cleanup? I just discovered http://wiki.flightgear.org/Modelling_guidelines)

(b) Instructions on how to contribute and maintain this model to/in the FGFS repository. http://wiki.flightgear.org/Portal:Developer/Aircraft didn't help me and neither did searching the forum. "Howto:Understand_the_FlightGear_development_process" is getting closer but still doesn't give me a recipe to follow (where to post, where to store, etc).

(c) Where is the preferred place to host "3rd party" aircraft if getting this into the main repository isn't feasible?

I've set up an Asus Chromebox ($180) running Ubuntu 14.04 linux and a Logitech Extreme 3d-pro as control device. I was able to follow instructions to install dg101g sailplane and additional terrain (that was easy!).

Locals (San Francisco) can see Alec Proudfoot's next DaSH presentation November 9th, 2014 at Hillar Aviation Museum (must pay admission):

    Hi,

    I think it's better to wait your next update before adding this aircraft to the fgaddon.
    As of today your aircraft looks mostly as a proof of concept or sketch.
    Until a human is modelled and added on a seat + 3D model is textured I don't see the interest to share it because the current state of your aircraft doesn't look like a WIP project but more like a "draft" of an aircraft.

    Keep me informed when you have done more work ;)

        Hi Clément!
        thanks for the response!

        No problem with deferring. This model is labeled "V1.0" exactly
        because it is a draft - but the flight dynamics appear to be (mostly)
        correct.

        Any suggestions on where I can/should park this model so other people
        who are interested can contribute the changes you are asking for?

        AFAICT, FlightGear currently has no human powered aircraft. I was
        hoping you might consider "lowering the bar" in order to give this
        type of model more "exposure" and make it easier to find people
        interested in improving the models (or vice versa: easier for people
        interested in the model to find it - even if it's "incomplete").

        Looking at the number of universities building this type of aircraft,
        it seems like there should be some students/professors interested in
        taking an existing model and improving/modifying it for use in their
        student run programs to train their own "pilots".

        BTW, top hit on google search for "flightgear human powered aircraft"
        is my posting :)
        http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=24495

        BTW(2): I did find a FliightGear model for "Gossamer Albatross" that I
        wasn't aware of before:
        https://gitorious.org/gossamer

        I'll try this out to see how it compares to DaSH V1 model.

        thanks!
