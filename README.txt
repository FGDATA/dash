DaSH PA - Dead Simple Human Powered Airplane
==========================================================

The DaSH project is using FlightGear to help train the DaSH pilots.  This model is "in development", and as such has no cockpit, instruments, fancy skins, etc.  It does, however, have well-modelled aerodynamics (from AVL and XROTOR), good estimates of mass and inertias, and a few moving parts.

This is an extremely large (109ft wingspan) and light (90lb empty weight) airplane. Recommend flying in low winds, unless you want a challenge.  Try initializing your flight at ~100ft AGL, or with sufficient airspeed to maintain wings-level.  Once your tip drags on the runway, it's hard to get flying again without wire-men.

Note, the only controls are a full-flying elevator, a full-flying rudder (actuated via control stick roll command), and a maximum of 1kW power (depending on how hard you can pedal).  Potential DaSH pilots must sustain 200W-300W (for body weight 130-180lbs to sustain level flight.  A moderately fit cyclist can achieve this output for at least 10 minutes, while competitive cyclists can sustain this output for hours.

Feedback and contributions to the model are welcome (Does it work for you? What needs cleanup? Can you animate wing bending as function of g-loading or rolling moment?)

All code is from scratch, but the AC file is courtesy of SunLightEagle model for CRRC sim.

Keep it low and slow,
